# ☕️ Cool-Chat<br/>
A messenger type app<br/>
I built a project that uses many technologies that i have learned. <br/>

More specifically:<br/>
-MVC<br/>
-AutoLayout<br/>
-UIKit & Foundation<br/>
-FireBase - Cloud Firestore API<br/>
-CocoaPods & Swift Package Manager<br/>
-Git & GitHub<br/>

It is a chat app that enables text communication between two iOS devices.<br/>

My app is capable of:<br/>
-Registering a new user<br/>
-Logging in your existing account<br/>
-Signing out from chat<br/>
-Sending a text message that is saved in cloud FireStore database<br/>
-Reloading chat TableView realtime and sorting messages basing on time interval<br/>
-Working on every iPhone available in portrait & landscape mode<br/>
