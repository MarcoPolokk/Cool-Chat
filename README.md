# ☕️ Cool-Chat
A messenger type app
I have build a project that uses many technologies that i have learned. 

More specifically:
-MVC
-AutoLayout
-UIKit & Foundation
-FireBase - Cloud Firestore API
-CocoaPods & Swift Package Manager
-Git & GitHub

It is a chat app that enables text communication between two iOS devices.

My app is capable of:
-Registering a new user
-Logging in your existing account
-Signing out from chat
-Sending a text message that is saved in cloud FireStore database
-Reloading chat TableView realtime and sorting messages basing on time interval
-Working on every iPhone available in portrait & landscape mode
